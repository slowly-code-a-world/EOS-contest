OVERVIEW

this repo contains source code and doc of the contest software
doc directory contains all the description of design and
implementation. Please read it to understand this software project.

code directory contains all source codes. Basically,
we modify four parts in the Linux kernel 3.8.8 to demonstrate our
idea. Specifically, disk scheduling, CPU scheduling, synchronization
and page replacement. There are three subdirs under code.
disk\_sched dir is the kernel code which finishes disk scheduling and 
cpu scheduling, syn is the code which finishes synchronization and 
pagecache is the code which finishes page cache replacement.
